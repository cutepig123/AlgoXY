AlgoXY

2011, April, 20

AlgoXY is a project for creating a free book about elementary 
algorithms and data structures. AlgoXY doesn't only focus on 
imperative (or procedural) approaching but also purely functional 
algorithms and data structures. It doesn't require readers to 
master any programming languages, because all the algorithms are 
described in both math functions as well as the pseudo codes.

For reference implementation purpose, source code in C, C++, Haskell,
Python, Scheme/Lisp are available along with the book.

The content of the book is provided under GNU FDL and the source
codes are under GNU GPLv3.

A draft version is available online at:
